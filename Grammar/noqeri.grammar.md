# noqeri 1.4 grammar

Noqeri deliberately keeps a familiar reading order while making low-level intent explicit. Semicolons are optional at statement boundaries, types follow names, casts use `as`, error propagation uses prefix `try`, and systems operations stay visible rather than being hidden behind compiler magic.

## Lexical layer

```text
IDENT          := (LETTER | "_") (LETTER | DIGIT | "_")*
DEC_INTEGER    := DIGIT+
HEX_INTEGER    := "0" ("x" | "X") HEX_DIGIT+
INTEGER        := DEC_INTEGER | HEX_INTEGER
FLOAT          := DIGIT+ "." DIGIT+
STRING         := '"' (ESCAPE | any-character-except-quote)* '"'
LINE_COMMENT   := "//" characters-until-newline
BLOCK_COMMENT  := "/*" characters-until-"*/" "*/"
```

Whitespace and comments may appear between tokens.

## Program structure

```text
program        := declaration* EOF

declaration    := modifiers? functionDecl
                | moduleDecl
                | importDecl
                | recordDecl
                | letDecl
                | statement

modifiers      := ("export" | "extern")+
moduleDecl     := "module" qualifiedName terminator?
importDecl     := "import" STRING terminator?
qualifiedName  := IDENT ("." IDENT)*
terminator     := ";"

functionDecl   := "function" IDENT genericParams?
                  "(" parameters? ")"
                  (":" type)?
                  (block | terminator?)

genericParams  := "<" IDENT ("," IDENT)* ">"
parameters     := parameter ("," parameter)*
parameter      := IDENT (":" type)?

recordDecl     := "record" IDENT "{" recordField* "}" terminator?
recordField    := IDENT ":" type ("," | terminator)?
```

## Types

```text
type           := pointerType
                | sliceType
                | arrayType
                | namedType

pointerType    := "*" "volatile"? type
sliceType      := "[" "]" type
arrayType      := "[" type ";" INTEGER "]"
namedType      := IDENT
```

Stable integer names are:

```text
u8  u16  u32  u64
 i8  i16  i32  i64
usize  isize
```

The existing `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `null`, and `void` types remain available.

Pointers are written `*T`. A volatile pointee access is written `*volatile T`. `&value` takes an address, `*pointer` dereferences, and indexing scales by the pointee or element size.

Fixed arrays use `[T; N]`; slices use `[]T`. A slice is a pointer-and-length view.

## Values and statements

```text
letDecl        := ("let" | "const") IDENT (":" type)? "=" expression terminator?

statement      := ifStmt
                | whileStmt
                | returnStmt
                | throwStmt
                | block
                | exprStmt

ifStmt         := "if" expression block ("else" (ifStmt | block))?
whileStmt      := "while" expression block
returnStmt     := "return" expression? terminator?
throwStmt      := "throw" expression terminator?
block          := "{" declaration* "}"
exprStmt       := expression terminator?
```

`const` bindings cannot be assigned after initialization. `if` and `while` conditions must be `bool`; integers are not silently treated as booleans.

## Expressions

```text
expression     := assignment
assignment     := assignTarget "=" assignment
                | logicalOr

assignTarget   := IDENT
                | postfixTarget
                | "*" unary

postfixTarget  := primary (indexSuffix | memberSuffix)+

logicalOr      := logicalAnd ("||" logicalAnd)*
logicalAnd     := equality ("&&" equality)*
equality       := comparison (("==" | "!=") comparison)*
comparison     := term (("<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=") term)*
term           := factor (("+" | "-") factor)*
factor         := unary (("*" | "/" | "%") unary)*
unary          := ("!" | "-" | "+" | "*" | "&" | "try") unary
                | cast
cast           := postfix ("as" type)*
postfix        := primary (callSuffix | indexSuffix | memberSuffix)*
callSuffix     := "(" arguments? ")"
arguments      := expression ("," expression)*
indexSuffix    := "[" expression "]"
memberSuffix   := "." IDENT

primary        := INTEGER
                | FLOAT
                | STRING
                | "true"
                | "false"
                | "null"
                | IDENT
                | arrayLiteral
                | "(" expression ")"

arrayLiteral   := "[" (expression ("," expression)*)? "]"
```

Assignments are valid only to names, fields, indexed elements, or dereferenced pointers. Arbitrary expressions are not assignable.

## Integer conversion rule

Noqeri distinguishes **provably safe implicit conversion** from **explicit conversion**:

- same-type assignment is allowed;
- same-signedness widening is implicit, such as `u8 -> u32`;
- unsigned-to-signed widening is implicit only when the signed destination is strictly wider, such as `u32 -> i64`;
- narrowing is not implicit;
- signed-to-unsigned conversion is not implicit;
- an integer literal may initialize a fixed-width integer when its value is provably in range;
- otherwise use `as` to make the conversion explicit.

Examples:

```nqr
let port: u16 = 8080       // valid: literal fits
let small: u8 = 42
let wide: u32 = small      // valid: safe widening

let count: u64 = 300
let byte: u8 = count       // error: narrowing
let forced: u8 = count as u8
```

The explicit cast communicates that truncation or signedness reinterpretation is intentional.

## Arrays and slices

Array literals infer their element type from their elements. `slice(array)` or `slice(pointer, length)` creates a slice, and `len(value)` accepts arrays and slices.

```nqr
let values: [int; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let view: []int = slice(values)
print(len(view))
print(view[2])
```

## Modules and generics

`module name` gives a source file an organizational identity. `import "path.nqr"` resolves recursively relative to the importing file. The current bootstrap merges imported declarations into one compilation graph; a stronger namespace model can evolve without changing file-import syntax.

Generic functions use inferred register-value type parameters:

```nqr
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
    return value
}
```

The bootstrap currently limits generics to values supported by the register-oriented ABI; aggregate monomorphization is not yet implied by this grammar.

## Error propagation

`throw code` and `try expression` provide allocation-free status propagation for integer-returning functions.

```nqr
function openDevice(): isize {
    throw 3
}

function start(): isize {
    let status: isize = try openDevice()
    return status
}
```

A thrown non-negative code is encoded as a negative status. `try` returns from the current function immediately when it receives a negative status.

## Systems built-ins

Atomics, CPU intrinsics, slicing helpers and inline assembly are ordinary call forms rather than separate grammar families:

```text
len(value)
slice(array)
slice(pointer, length)

atomic.load(pointer)
atomic.store(pointer, value)
atomic.exchange(pointer, value)
atomic.compareExchange(pointer, expected, desired)
atomic.fence()

intrinsic("x86.pause")
asm("nop")
```

Atomic operands must be bool, integer, or pointer values no wider than 8 bytes in the current backend.

`record` uses declaration-order, naturally aligned field layout. `extern function` declares a symbol supplied by the embedding/linking environment. `export function` emits the declared name as an externally visible native symbol.

These are general language facilities for applications, libraries, embedded software, runtimes, concurrency, FFI, kernels, and other performance-sensitive programs. They are not an operating-system-specific dialect.
